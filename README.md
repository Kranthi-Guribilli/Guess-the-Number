# Guess-the-Number

## Created an old 80's game, while learning JavaScript.

## How to play?
It is a simple number guessing game, in which a random number from 1-100 will be selected and you have to guess it.<br>
If your guess is too high or too low, you will get a hint.
## One can also decide the number of checks that he/she want, using the settings button on the top right corner!
